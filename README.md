<h1 align="center"> Hi there! Welcome to my working space! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm Camila Cufre, a passionate web developer, an independent illustrator and a Computer Science Student with a great love for technology.

ðŸ“š Throughout my education, I have worked on various projects, ranging from Frontend development, where I bring web designs to life and create interactive interfaces, to Backend development, where I efficiently manage databases, consume APIs, and handle server requests.

ðŸŽ¨ In addition to my passion for technology, I am also an independent illustrator. I love combining my web development skills with my artistic creativity to create unique and visually appealing experiences.

ðŸš€ Technology is my greatest passion, and I believe it plays a fundamental role in our lives, with its importance continuing to grow alongside technological advancements. Investing in and contributing to this growth is essential for all sectors of society.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to build my career in companies that provide a dynamic learning environment and constant growth opportunities. I aim to grow both personally and professionally while contributing to the technological advancements that I am so passionate about, combining my web development skills with my love for illustration.

âš¡ Weird fact: I hate some words just for the way them sound.
